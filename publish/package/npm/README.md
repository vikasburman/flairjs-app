Introduction 
---

JavaScript is everywhere, and its popularity has grown tremendously. There has been several enhancements done in the language to make it more powerful. ES6/ES7 has added several object-oriented features to the language, but the bottleneck has always been the varied support of these features by web browsers, thus restricting their large-scale usage.


Besides, due to rich and long history of JavaScript, several compatibility issues do exists. Expecting to have all awesome object-oriented concepts as they exists in any new languages like C#, Java, etc., is tough.

_Flair.js_ takes the problem head-on and brings majority of the awesomeness of C#/Java features in JavaScript, natively! Basic object oriented concepts like, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, events, together with advance features like aspect oriented and attribute based programming, custom attributes, serialization, 
dependency injection and reflection, etc. are all nicely baked in this tiny JavaScript library.

All of these are available via pure JavaScript syntax, without any build-time transpilation or compilation 
of your codebase.
                  
The forward-looking and future-proof design of the library, plays well with ongoing Ecmascript advancements, and uses available new JavaScript constructs behind the scenes, wherever possible and supported.

This works in web browsers and in other JavaScript environments like [Node](https://nodejs.org) and [NW.js](https://nwjs.io/).

Features
---
* Pure JavaScript, No external dependencies, ~25k min+gz.
* **Inheritance:** Single inheritance chain, Multiple inheritance via Mixins, Restrictions via 'sealed', etc. 
* **Encapsulation:** True Public, Private and Protected members etc.
* **Polymorphism:** Abstract classes, Interfaces, Method overloading and overriding, Restrictions via 'sealed', Dynamic casting via 'as', etc.
* **Mature Base Types:** Class, Struct, Interface, Mixin, Enum, Exception, etc.
* **Aspect orientation:** Aspect definitions with Before, After and Around advise weaving on methods.
* **Attributes based programming:** Inbuilt system attributes like 'readonly', 'sealed' and many more with full-blown support of defining custom attributes and its usage over class and class members.
* **Dependency injection:** Object life-cycle management via DI container and constructor, method and property injection of registered types.
* **Serialization:** Seamless serialization and deserialization of class objects for persistance and transfer.
* **Reflection:** Meta programming made easy with advance reflection support on all live objects and base types.
* **Type organization:** Organization of types under individual namespaces and assemblies.
* **Others:** Singleton, Static classes and members, State storage, Event handling, Async method calls, Auto-disposable objects, deprecate member notifications, Telemetry, Extension ports, etc.

Getting Started
---
**1. Install**

Install using `npm install flairjs` or download [latest release](https://github.com/vikasburman/flairjs/releases/latest). All you need is to have `flair.min.js` available, whatever approach you want to take.


**2. Include**

Include Flair.js in your html page or load it as a module, and initialize.

> There are no external dependencies of this library, therefore feel free to include in whatever order required. However this must be loaded before any `*.js` file which uses Flair.js features, for them to be available.

When using on client side:
```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="path/flair.min.js"></script>
```

> Flair.js also support module loaders and can be loaded via `require` or other module loading techniques.

When using on server side:
```javascript
const flair = require('flairjs');
```

**3. Play with Objects**

With flair functions/objects available, JavaScript now has the awesomeness of C#/Java. Define and play with objects.

Here is a quick example:

```javascript

const { Class, $$, event, using } = flair;

// define Vehicle class
let Vehicle = Class('Vehicle', function() {
    
    // constructor
    this.construct = (capacity) => {
        this.cc = capacity;
        console.log('Vehicle constructed!');    
    };
    
    // property
    this.cc = 0;

    // method
    this.start = () => {
        // raise event with current time of start
        this.started(Date.now());
    };

    // event
    this.started = event((time) => {
        return { when: time }; // event args
    });
});

```

```javascript

// define Car, derived from Vehicle
let Car = Class('Car', Vehicle, function() {
    
    $$('override'); // constructor overriding
    this.construct = (base, model, capacity) => {
        // call base class's constructor
        base(capacity);
        this.model = model;

        // subscribe to started event of base class
        this.started.add((e) => {
            // read event args, this and parent class properties
            console.log(`${this.model} (${this.cc}cc) ${e.name} at: ${e.args.when}`);
        });
        console.log('Car constructed!');    
    });

    $$('readonly'); // model is readonly, but can still be defined in constructor
    this.model = '';

    // dispose car via destructor
    this.dispose = () => {
        console.log('Car disposed!');
    };     
});

```

```javascript

// auto disposable block
using(new Car('SUV', 3000), (suv) => {
    suv.start();
});

```

Executing above code will show following on console: 
```
Vehicle constructed!

Car constructed!

SUV (3000cc) started at: (time)

Car disposed!
```

Explore The Power
---
What you have seen above is the tip of the iceberg. Flair.js adds a lot of firepower to JavaScript that makes building complex JavaScript projects as easy as with C# or Java.

To tap the real power of Flair.js, explore the [Guides](https://flairjs.com/#/guides) to understand concepts and behaviors, [API](https://flairjs.com/#/api) to know details of each exposed programming interface of various constructs and finally [Examples](https://flairjs.com/#/examples) to see real codebase showcasing all these concepts in action. 

However, before you delve deep into any of these areas, begin with getting an [Overview](https://flairjs.com/#/overview) first.
